    <title>The Executor (thread pool)</title>
  </properties>

<body>


<section name="Introduction">

  <p>The <strong>Executor</strong> represents a thread pool that can be shared 
     between components in JBoss Web. Historically there has been a thread pool per
     connector created but this allows you to share a thread pool, between (primarly) connector
     but also other components when those get configured to support executors</p>


  <p>The <code>executor</code> is defined in the <code>subsystem=threads</code>
     See <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Admin+Guide">AS7 Admin Guide</a>
     for more on the threads system.
  </p>

<section name="Example">

  <p>To demonstrate how a the logic works a <code>thread-pool</code>
  was added to the <code>subsystem=threads</code> and used in the
  <code>subsystem=web/connector=http</code>:</p>

  <subsection name="subsystem=threads">
  <p>A <code>thread-pool</code> named "http" has been added it uses a
     <code>thread-factory</code> that creates threads named "HTTP-number"
  </p>

[standalone@localhost:9999 /] ./subsystem=threads:read-resource(recursive=true)
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => {
        "bounded-queue-thread-pool" => undefined,
        "queueless-thread-pool" => undefined,
        "scheduled-thread-pool" => undefined,
        "thread-factory" => {"http" => {
            "name" => "http",
            "priority" => 9,
            "thread-name-pattern" => "HTTP-%t"
        }},
        "unbounded-queue-thread-pool" => {"http" => {
            "max-threads" => {
                "count" => big decimal 10,
                "per-cpu" => big decimal 20
            },

            "thread-factory" => "http"
        }}
    }
}

  <subsection name="the connector using it">

  <p>That is just a standard http <code>connector</code> that uses the
     thread-pool defined above.
