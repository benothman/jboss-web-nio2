    <section name="Introduction">
        <p>
            Deployment is the term used for the process of installing a web
            application (either a 3rd party WAR or your own custom web application) 
            into the JBoss Web server. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Web application deployment may be accomplished in a number of ways
            within the JBoss Web server.
            <ul>
                <li>Statically; the web application is setup before JBoss Web is started</li>
                <li>
                    Dynamically; Using the command line or the Web Management Interface of AS7
                    or manipulating already deployed web applications
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section name="Installation">
        <p>
            There is no installation required for static or dynamic deployment of web
            applications as this is provided out of the box by JBoss Web. Nor is any
            installation required for deployment functions with the JBoss Web Manager, 
            although some configuration is required as detailed in the 
            JBoss Web Manager manual.
        </p>   
    </section>
        
    <section name="A word on Contexts">
        <p>
            In talking about deployment of web applications, the concept of a
            <i>Context</i> is required to be understood. A Context is what JBoss Web 
            calls a web application.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to configure a Context within JBoss Web a <i>Context Descriptor</i>
            is required. A Context Descriptor is simply an XML file that contains
            JBoss Web related configuration for a Context, e.g naming resources or 
            session manager configuration.
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section name="Deployment on JBoss Web startup">
        <p>
            If you are not interested in using the JBoss Web Manager, or TCD, 
            then you'll need to deploy your web applications 
            statically to JBoss Web, followed by a JBoss Web startup. The location you
            deploy web applications to for this type of deployment is called the 
            <code>appBase</code> which is specified per Host. You either copy a
            so-called <i>exploded web application</i>, i.e non-compressed, to this
            location, or a compressed web application resource .WAR file.
        </p>
        <p>
            The web applications present in the location 
            ${jboss.server.base.dir}/standalone/deployments/
            will be deployed on JBoss Web startup.
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section name="Deploying on a running JBoss Web server">
        <p>
            It is possible to deploy web applications to a running JBoss Web server.
        </p>
        <p>
            Depending on the <code>deployment-scanner</code> configuration
            the application web are deployed dynamicly and/or 
            updated, the <code>deployment-scanner</code> is a sub system:
<source>
[standalone@localhost:9999 /] ./subsystem=deployment-scanner:read-resource(recursive=true)
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => {"scanner" => {"default" => {
        "auto-deploy-exploded" => true,
        "auto-deploy-zipped" => true,
        "deployment-timeout" => 60L,
        "name" => "default",
        "path" => "deployments",
        "relative-to" => "jboss.server.base.dir",
        "scan-enabled" => true,
        "scan-interval" => 5000
    }}}
}
</source>
        </p><p>
            For example if a new .WAR is dropped into the <code>${jboss.server.base.dir}/standalone/deployments/</code>
            directory it will be deployed automaticly.
        </p>
       
        <p>The webapps are deployed or redeployed in the following cases:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Deployment of .WAR files copied into the <code>${jboss.server.base.dir}/standalone/deployments/</code> directory.
            </li>
            <li>
                Deployment of exploded web applications which that are copied there too.
            </li>
            <li>
                Re-deployment of a web application which has already been deployed from
                a .WAR when the new .WAR is provided.
            </li>
            <li>
                Re-deployment of a web application if the /WEB-INF/web.xml file (or any
                other resource defined as a WatchedResource) is updated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Undeployment of a web application if the .WAR file is removed of the
                exploded files are removed.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <section name="Deploying using the command line">
        <p>
            Use the command line:
            <code>${jboss.server.base.dir}/bin/jboss-admin.sh</code>
            For example:
 <source>
 bin/jboss-admin.sh
