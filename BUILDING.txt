            ============================================
            Building The JBoss Web Servlet/JSP Container
            ============================================

This subproject contains the source code for JBoss Web, a container that
implements the Servlet 2.5 and JSP 2.1 specifications from the Java
Community Process <http://www.jcp.org/>.  In order to build a binary
distribution version of the container from a source distribution, 
do the following:


(0) Download and Install a Java Development Kit

* If the JDK is already installed, skip to (1).

* Download a Java Development Kit (JDK) release (version 1.5.x or later) from:

    http://java.sun.com/j2se/

* Install the JDK according to the instructions included with the release.

* Set an environment variable JAVA_HOME to the pathname of the directory
  into which you installed the JDK release.


(1) Install Apache Ant 1.6.x or above on your computer

* If Apache Ant 1.6.x or above is already installed on your computer, skip to (2).

* Download a binary distribution of Ant 1.6.x or above from:

    http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

* Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so that the
  Ant release resides in its own directory (conventionally named
  "apache-ant-[version]").  For the purposes of the remainder of this document,
  the symbolic name "${ant.home}" is used to refer to the full pathname of
  the release directory.

* Create an ANT_HOME environment variable to point the directory
  ${ant.home}.

* Modify the PATH environment variable to include the directory
  ${ant.home}/bin in its list.  This makes the "ant" command line script
  available, which will be used to actually perform the build.


(2) Building JBoss Web

(2.1) Checkout or obtain the source code for JBoss Web

* JBoss Web SVN repository URL:
  http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbossweb/trunk/

* Download a source package from:
  http://labs.jboss.com/jbossweb/

* Checkout the source using SVN, selecting the desired version or
  branch (current development source is at 
  http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/jbossweb/trunk/), or 
  unpack the source package. The location where the source has been
  placed will be referred as ${jboss-web.source}.

(2.2) Building

* Go to that directory, and do:

    cd ${jboss-web.source}
    ant download
    ant

* NOTE: Users accessing the Internet through a proxy must use a properties
  file to indicate to Ant the proxy configuration. Read below.

* WARNING: Running this command will download binaries to the /usr/share/java 
  directory. Make sure this is appropriate to do on your computer. On Windows, 
  this usually corresponds to the "C:\usr\share\java" directory, unless Cygwin 
  is used. Read below to customize the directory used to download the binaries.

* The build can be controlled by creating a ${jboss-web.source}/build.properties
  file, and adding the following content to it:

    # ----- Proxy setup -----
    # Uncomment if using a proxy server
    #proxy.host=proxy.domain
    #proxy.port=8080
    #proxy.use=on

    # ----- Default Base Path for Dependent Packages -----
    # Replace this path with the directory path where dependencies binaries
    # should be downloaded
    base.path=/usr/share/java


(3) Updating sources

It is recommended that you regularly update the downloaded JBoss Web sources
using your SVN client.

(4) Rebuilds

For a quick rebuild of only modified code you can use:
   
    cd ${jboss-web.source}
    ant

(5) Building EL parser with JavaCC 4.1+:

    Download JavaCC 4.1+
    export JAVACC_HOME=/somepath/javacc-4.1
    export PATH=$JAVACC_HOME/bin:$PATH
    cd ${jboss-web.source}/java/org/apache/el/parser
    jjtree ELParser.jjt
    javacc ELParser.jj
