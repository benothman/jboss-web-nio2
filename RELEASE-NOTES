                            Release Notes


===================
Dependency Changes:
===================
JBoss Web 3.0 is designed to run on JSE 6.0 and later, and requires
configuration to run on JSE 6.0.

In addition, JBoss Web 3.0 uses the Eclipse JDT Java compiler for compiling
JSP pages.  This means you no longer need to have the complete
Java Development Kit (JDK) to run Tomcat, but a Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) is sufficient.  The Eclipse JDT Java compiler is bundled with the 
binary Tomcat distributions.  Tomcat can also be configured to use the
compiler from the JDK to compile JSPs, or any other Java compiler supported 
by Apache Ant.


=======================
JNI Based Applications:
=======================
Applications that require native libraries must ensure that the libraries have
been loaded prior to use.  Typically, this is done with a call like:

  static {
    System.loadLibrary("path-to-library-file");
  }

in some class.  However, the application must also ensure that the library is
not loaded more than once.  If the above code were placed in a class inside
the web application (i.e. under /WEB-INF/classes or /WEB-INF/lib), and the
application were reloaded, the loadLibrary() call would be attempted a second
time.

To avoid this problem, place classes that load native libraries outside of the
web application, and ensure that the loadLibrary() call is executed only once
during the lifetime of a particular JVM.


=============================
Enabling SSI and CGI Support:
=============================
SSI, CGI will only will run in privileged web applications. See the Context
attributes documentation for more details.
 

============================
Symlinking static resources:
============================
By default, Unix symlinks will not work when used in a web application to link
resources located outside the web application root directory.

This behavior is optional, and the "allowLinking" flag may be used to disable
the check.
