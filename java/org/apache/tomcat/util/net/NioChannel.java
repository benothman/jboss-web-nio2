/**
 * {@code NioChannel}
 * 
 * <p>
 * An asynchronous channel for stream-oriented connecting sockets.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NIO Asynchronous socket channels are created in one of two ways. A
 * newly-created {@code NioChannel} is created by invoking one of the
 * {@link #open open} methods defined by this class. A newly-created channel is
 * open but not yet connected. A connected {@code NioChannel} is created when a
 * connection is made to the socket of an
 * {@link AsynchronousServerSocketChannel}. It is not possible to create an
 * asynchronous socket channel for an arbitrary, pre-existing
 * {@link java.net.Socket socket}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A newly-created channel is connected by invoking its {@link #connect connect}
 * method; once connected, a channel remains connected until it is closed.
 * Whether or not a socket channel is connected may be determined by invoking
 * its {@link #getRemoteAddress getRemoteAddress} method. An attempt to invoke
 * an I/O operation upon an unconnected channel will cause a
 * {@link NotYetConnectedException} to be thrown.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. They
 * support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one read operation and
 * one write operation can be outstanding at any time. If a thread initiates a
 * read operation before a previous read operation has completed then a
 * {@link ReadPendingException} will be thrown. Similarly, an attempt to
 * initiate a write operation before a previous write has completed will throw a
 * {@link WritePendingException}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Socket options are configured using the
 * {@link #setOption(SocketOption,Object) setOption} method. NIO Asynchronous
 * socket channels support the following options:
 * </p>
 * <blockquote>
 * <table border>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Option Name</th>
 * <th>Description</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_SNDBUF SO_SNDBUF}</td>
 * <td>The size of the socket send buffer</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF}</td>
 * <td>The size of the socket receive buffer</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_KEEPALIVE SO_KEEPALIVE}</td>
 * <td>Keep connection alive</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR}</td>
 * <td>Re-use address</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td> {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#TCP_NODELAY TCP_NODELAY}</td>
 * <td>Disable the Nagle algorithm</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * </blockquote> Additional (implementation specific) options may also be
 * supported.
 * 
 * <h4>Timeouts</h4>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The {@link #read(ByteBuffer,long,TimeUnit,Object,CompletionHandler) read} and
 * {@link #write(ByteBuffer,long,TimeUnit,Object,CompletionHandler) write}
 * methods defined by this class allow a timeout to be specified when initiating
 * a read or write operation. If the timeout elapses before an operation
 * completes then the operation completes with the exception
 * {@link java.nio.channels.InterruptedByTimeoutException}. A timeout may leave
 * the channel, or the underlying connection, in an inconsistent state. Where
 * the implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been read from the
 * channel then it puts the channel into an implementation specific
 * <em>error state</em>. A subsequent attempt to initiate a {@code read}
 * operation causes an unspecified runtime exception to be thrown. Similarly if
 * a {@code write} operation times out and the implementation cannot guarantee
 * bytes have not been written to the channel then further attempts to
 * {@code write} to the channel cause an unspecified runtime exception to be
 * thrown. When a timeout elapses then the state of the
 * {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer}, or the sequence of buffers, for the I/O
 * operation is not defined. Buffers should be discarded or at least care must
 * be taken to ensure that the buffers are not accessed while the channel
 * remains open. All methods that accept timeout parameters treat values less
 * than or equal to zero to mean that the I/O operation does not timeout.
 * </p>
