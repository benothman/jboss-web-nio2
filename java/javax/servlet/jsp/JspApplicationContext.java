/**
 * Stores application-scoped information relevant to JSP containers.
 *
 * <p>The JSP container must create a single instance of
 * <code>JspApplicationContext</code> for each
 * <code>ServletContext</code> instance.</p>
 *
 * <p>An instance of <code>JspApplicationContext</code> is obtained by
 * invoking the static {@link JspFactory#getJspApplicationContext} method,
 * passing the <code>ServletContext</code> of the corresponding web
 * application.</p>
 *
 * <p>The <code>JspApplicationContext</code> provides the following services
 * to JSP applications:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Allows registration of <code>ELResolver</code>s, which are used to
 *       resolve variables in EL expressions contained in JSP pages and
 *       tag files.</li>
 *   <li>Provides an instance of <code>ExpressionFactory</code> for those
 *       applications or frameworks that need to perform programmatic
 *       evaluation of EL expressions instead of allowing the JSP
 *       container to do it for them.</li>
 *   <li>Allows the attachment of <code>ELContextListener</code> instances
 *       for notification whenever a new <code>ELContext</code> is created.
 *       This is necessary when an application wishes to make custom
 *       context objects available to their pluggable
 *       <code>ELResolver</code>s.</li>
 * </ul>

     * Adds an <code>ELResolver</code> to affect the way EL variables
     * and properties are resolved for EL expressions appearing in JSP pages
     * and tag files.
     *
     * <p>For example, in the EL expression ${employee.lastName}, an
     * <code>ELResolver</code> determines what object "employee"
     * references and how to find its "lastName" property.</p>
     *
     * <p>When evaluating an expression, the JSP container will consult a
     * set of standard resolvers as well as any resolvers registered via
     * this method. The set of resolvers are consulted in the following
     * order:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@link javax.servlet.jsp.el.ImplicitObjectELResolver}</li>
     *   <li><code>ELResolver</code>s registered via this method, in the

     * <p>It is illegal to register an <code>ELResolver</code> after the

     * attempt is made to register an <code>ELResolver</code> after that time,
     * an <code>IllegalStateException</code> is thrown.</p>
     * This restriction is
     * in place to allow the JSP container to optimize for the common
     * case where no additional <code>ELResolver</code>s are in the chain,
     * aside from the standard ones. It is permissible to add
     * <code>ELResolver</code>s before or after initialization to
     * a <code>CompositeELResolver</code> that is already in the chain.</p>
     *
     * <p>It is not possible to remove an <code>ELResolver</code> registered
     * with this method, once it has been registered.</p>
     *

     * @throws IllegalStateException if an attempt is made to
     *     call this method after all <code>ServletContextListener</code>s
     *     have had their <code>contextInitialized</code> methods invoked.
