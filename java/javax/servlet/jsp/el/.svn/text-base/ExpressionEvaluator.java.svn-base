/**
 * <p>The abstract base class for an expression-language evaluator.
 * Classes that implement an expression language expose their functionality
 * via this abstract class.</p>
 *
 * <p>An instance of the ExpressionEvaluator can be obtained via the 
 * JspContext / PageContext</p>
 *
 * <p>The parseExpression() and evaluate() methods must be thread-safe.  
 * That is, multiple threads may call these methods on the same 
 * ExpressionEvaluator object simultaneously.  Implementations should 
 * synchronize access if they depend on transient state.  Implementations 
 * should not, however, assume that only one object of each 
 * ExpressionEvaluator type will be instantiated; global caching should 
 * therefore be static.</p>
 *
 * <p>Only a single EL expression, starting with '${' and ending with
 * '}', can be parsed or evaluated at a time.  EL expressions 
 * cannot be mixed with static text.  For example, attempting to 
 * parse or evaluate "<code>abc${1+1}def${1+1}ghi</code>" or even
 * "<code>${1+1}${1+1}</code>" will cause an <code>ELException</code> to
 * be thrown.</p>
 *
 * <p>The following are examples of syntactically legal EL expressions:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>${person.lastName}</code></li>
 *   <li><code>${8 * 8}</code></li>
 *   <li><code>${my:reverse('hello')}</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * @deprecated As of JSP 2.1, replaced by {@link javax.el.ExpressionFactory}
 * @since JSP 2.0
