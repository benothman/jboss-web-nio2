/**
 * The IterationTag interface extends Tag by defining one additional
 * method that controls the reevaluation of its body.
 *
 * <p> A tag handler that implements IterationTag is treated as one that
 * implements Tag regarding  the doStartTag() and doEndTag() methods.
 * IterationTag provides a new method: <code>doAfterBody()</code>.
 *
 * <p> The doAfterBody() method is invoked after every body evaluation
 * to control whether the body will be reevaluated or not.  If doAfterBody()
 * returns IterationTag.EVAL_BODY_AGAIN, then the body will be reevaluated.
 * If doAfterBody() returns Tag.SKIP_BODY, then the body will be skipped
 * and doEndTag() will be evaluated instead.
 *
 * <p><B>Properties</B>
 * There are no new properties in addition to those in Tag.
 *
 * <p><B>Methods</B>
 * There is one new methods: doAfterBody().
 *
 * <p><B>Lifecycle</B>
 *
 * <p> Lifecycle details are described by the transition diagram
 * below.  Exceptions that are thrown during the computation of
 * doStartTag(), BODY and doAfterBody() interrupt the execution
 * sequence and are propagated up the stack, unless the tag handler
 * implements the TryCatchFinally interface; see that interface for
 * details.
 *
 * <p>
 * <IMG src="doc-files/IterationTagProtocol.gif"
 *      alt="Lifecycle Details Transition Diagram for IterationTag"/>
 *
 * <p><B>Empty and Non-Empty Action</B>
 * <p> If the TagLibraryDescriptor file indicates that the action must
 * always have an empty element body, by a &lt;body-content&gt; entry of 
 * "empty", then the doStartTag() method must return SKIP_BODY.
 *
 * <p>Note that which methods are invoked after the doStartTag() depends on
 * both the return value and on if the custom action element is empty
 * or not in the JSP page, not on how it's declared in the TLD.
 *
 * <p>
 * If SKIP_BODY is returned the body is not evaluated, and then doEndTag()
 * is invoked.
 *
 * <p>
 * If EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE is returned, and the custom action element is not
 * empty, the body is evaluated and "passed through" to the current out, 
 * then doAfterBody() is invoked and, after zero or more iterations, 
 * doEndTag() is invoked.
