/**
 * Optional class provided by the tag library author to describe additional
 * translation-time information not described in the TLD.
 * The TagExtraInfo class is mentioned in the Tag Library Descriptor file (TLD).
 *
 * <p>
 * This class can be used:
 * <ul>
 * <li> to indicate that the tag defines scripting variables
 * <li> to perform translation-time validation of the tag attributes.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is the responsibility of the JSP translator that the initial value
 * to be returned by calls to getTagInfo() corresponds to a TagInfo
 * object for the tag being translated. If an explicit call to
 * setTagInfo() is done, then the object passed will be returned in
 * subsequent calls to getTagInfo().
 * 
 * <p>
 * The only way to affect the value returned by getTagInfo()
 * is through a setTagInfo() call, and thus, TagExtraInfo.setTagInfo() is
 * to be called by the JSP translator, with a TagInfo object that
 * corresponds to the tag being translated. The call should happen before
 * any invocation on validate() and before any invocation on
 * getVariableInfo().
 *
 * <p>
 * <tt>NOTE:</tt> It is a (translation time) error for a tag definition
 * in a TLD with one or more variable subelements to have an associated
 * TagExtraInfo implementation that returns a VariableInfo array with
 * one or more elements from a call to getVariableInfo().
