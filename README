 This fork of the JBoss web project aims to provide a new web connector based on
 JavaSE 7 NIO2 features(asynchronous channels) . All old connectors remain available
 for use. To build this project, please refer to the file BUILDING.txt.
 
 Notes:
  1) To be able to build this project you need JDK-1.7 since we use Java 7 features.
  2) To test the new connector (NIO2 connector), you need also to have a fresh build
  	 of JBoss AS 7. You can download sources from it's github repository.
  	 Build JBoss AS 7 using JDK-1.6 and run it with JRE-1.7 (required).
  	 
  	 https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as
  3) Copy the result jars ( $PROJECT_HOME/output/jars/) in the directory
     « $JBOSS_INSTALL_DIR/modules/org/jboss/as/web/main/ »
  4) Edit the file « $JBOSS_INSTALL_DIR/modules/org/jboss/as/web/main/module.xml » to
     add the earlier copied jars as resources as replacement of the old ones
  5) Refer to the JBoss AS 7 guide to configure and use the new connector.
