 This fork of the JBoss web project aims to provide a new web connector based on
 Java-SE 7 NIO2 features(asynchronous channels) . All old connectors remain available
 for use. To build this project, please refer to the file BUILDING.txt.
 This project is intended to be used with JBoss AS 7.
 
 Notes:
  1) To be able to build this project you need JDK-1.7 since we use Java 7 features.
     You can download it from the following link:
     
     http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
      
  2) To test the new connector (NIO2 connector), download JBoss Application Server 7 
     from the link below, note that we tested this connector using JBoss AS 7.1.1 
     Final:
	 
	 JBoss AS download link: http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads
    	 
  3) Copy the result jars ( $PROJECT_HOME/output/jars/) in the directory
     « $JBOSS_INSTALL_DIR/modules/org/jboss/as/web/main/ ».
     
  4) Edit the file « $JBOSS_INSTALL_DIR/modules/org/jboss/as/web/main/module.xml » to
     add the earlier copied jars as resources as replacement of the old ones.
     
  5) Copy the files listed below in the same directory and rename them to the earlier 
     copied jars within the extension « .index »
  
     * « $JBOSS_INSTALL_DIR/modules/org/jboss/as/web/main/jbossweb-7.0.13.Final.jar.index »
     * « $JBOSS_INSTALL_DIR/modules/org/jboss/as/web/main/jasper-jdt-7.0.3.Final.jar.index »
     
     Example: if the jar copied is named « jbossweb.jar », the index file will be 
              named « jbossweb.jar.index »
     
  6) Refer to the JBoss AS 7 guide to configure and use the new connector.
