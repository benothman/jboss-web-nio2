Dropped Tomcat patches
SVN URL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=XXXXXX&view=rev

701358
Some symlink fix (too many checks needed)

701355
XML parser in webapp fix (significant refactoring, partial)

709821
Endline configuration for PrintWriter based on a server system property

709018
Async logger is not ready

710179
Invoker servlet removal

711711 711714 711716 711720
Useless session access time refactoring

719602
Dynamic change for maxThreads in the bare bones thread pool, which goes against its simplicity goal
(an executor should be used instead)

720728
Multiple pollers, which adds the complexity of needing a map to track to which poller a connection belongs 
(needed in IO event mode). There are 3 pollers already, which should be able to handle a lot of traffic. 

various
All changesets introducing generics, which have small value (new code or refactorings should use generics,
however)

724886
Executor modifications, very specialized work that breaks the Executor design (a single task can be submitted
to the real executor more than once) to supposedly work better with the NIO connector. 

various
New JDBC pool module

733748
SSL session tracking (may not be practical at all)

733768 733769 733775
Generics in Servlet API (not accepted yet)

733771
Deprecate some wrapper methods in Servlet API (not accepted yet)

751502
Per context validation (incomplete, and looks a bit useless anyway)

752651, 752936
XmlBase configuration

757223
AJP hack to pass remote port (the protocol does not do it, well, too bad)

763654
Specific hack to address some error condition in HTTP method

765727 (reverted)
ETag should normally be different if the content encoding changes; content-encoding is used because
transfer-encoding does not work with IE, and is not normally appropriate for transparent compression

770809
Fix 47080: NPE in RealmBase.findSecurityConstraints when uri is null (normally useless, a redirection should always occur)

770876
Windows 64 bit stuff ... Zzzzz

781036
Some configBase creation flag

781779 and all followups
Useless syncing

782000 782005 782007 782010 782013 782032
Changes to APR init

784083
Useless alias feature, redundant with overlays

890139
EL coercion patch

920449
Generating broken pages using included error pages
